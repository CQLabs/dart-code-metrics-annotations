# DCM Annotations

DCM is an advanced linter for Dart and Flutter that helps you analyze and improve your code quality. You can find all available lint rules [here](https://dcm.dev/docs/rules/).

## How to use annotations

Take these steps to use annotations:

1. Install this package as a **regular** dependency:

   ```terminal
   dart pub add dart_code_metrics_annotations
   ```

   or:

   ```terminal
   flutter pub add dart_code_metrics_annotations
   ```

2. Enable rules that rely on DCM annotations and add those annotations to your code.
